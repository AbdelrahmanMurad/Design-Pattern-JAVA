Project Using the Singleton Pattern

Purpose of Singleton Pattern:
  - The Singleton Pattern is used when we want to ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

- Examples of Where It’s Used:
  - Window Manager: You don’t need to create a new window manager every time you open a window; a single instance handles all windows.
  - File System: One file system instance can manage access to files across multiple applications.
  - Print Spooler: All print requests are sent to a single instance that manages them.

- Why Singleton Pattern Is Simple:
  - Only one class is needed.
  - There is one central instance for all operations (i.e., a single object used throughout the application).

- Implementation Example in a Class:
  
  - CountryCodeDictionaryClass: Let’s assume we are implementing a singleton for a dictionary of country codes.
  
  - Steps to Implement:
    1. Private HashMap: 
       - In Java, you use a `HashMap` to store the dictionary. In JavaScript, this would be similar to a `HashTable` or an object.
       - The `HashMap` is initialized inside the constructor.
  
    2. Private Constructor:
       - The constructor needs to be private to prevent creating multiple instances from outside the class.
       - This enforces that the object can only be created once.
       - We need a replacement for the constructor. Continue Reading...

    3. Static Variable:
       - Create a static variable inside the class to hold the single instance of `CountryCodeDictionaryClass`.
       - This static variable ensures that the instance is shared across the entire application.
       - name the variable as instance. [the name is not mandatory]
  
    4. Static Method (`getInstance`): [replacement]
       - Create a static method called `getInstance()`. This method will return the single instance of the class.
       - The method checks if the instance is `null` or not:
         - If `true` (i.e., instance is `null`), it creates a new instance.
         - If `false` (i.e., instance is already created), it returns the existing instance.

    - Why Static Variable & Method?
      - The static variable allows the class to maintain one shared instance. [to create the replacement]
      - The static method provides access to the instance from outside the class without creating an object of the class.

    - Why syncronized?
      - To control on multithreads situatuin.
 
    - Code Example:
      ```java
      public class CountryCodeDictionary {
          // Static variable to hold the single instance
          private static CountryCodeDictionary instance;
          
          // Private constructor to prevent external instantiation
          private CountryCodeDictionary() {
              // Initialize the HashMap here
          }

          // Static method to provide access to the single instance
          public static syncronized CountryCodeDictionary getInstance() {
              if (instance == null) {
                  instance = new CountryCodeDictionary();
              }
              return instance;
          }
      }
      ```

- Advantages of Singleton Pattern:
  - Ensures only one instance of the class is created.
  - Saves memory and resources by reusing the existing instance.
  - Provides a global point of access to the instance.

### Key Takeaways:
1. The Singleton Pattern ensures only one instance of a class exists.
2. The constructor is private, and access to the instance is through a static `getInstance()` method.
3. It is widely used in situations where a single resource (e.g., window manager, file system, print spooler) is shared across the entire application.

This version is correct, properly structured, and should help clarify your understanding of the Singleton Pattern.
