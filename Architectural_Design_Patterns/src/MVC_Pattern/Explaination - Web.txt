- Model–view–controller: Software architectural pattern
- Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces 
  that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate 
  internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.
- Traditionally used for desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs), this pattern became popular for designing web
  applications. Popular programming languages have MVC frameworks that facilitate the implementation of the pattern.
    - Model: Entitie => class-student, class-teacher, class-course.
    - View: User Interface - UI
    - Controller: Operations
[user <--> middleware <--> routes <--> view <--> controller <--> model <--> DB]

- From View you can deal with UI
- From Controller you can deal with operations
- From Model you can deal with database.


How does it work to get database??
    1. User sees the View, the request goes to the Controller.
    2. The operation is on the Controller, and it needs to get database from the Model, because the Model is resposible
       on getting database from the place where it is, Then from the Model to the Controller to the View. 
    - So, the Controller is a link between the Model and the View.
    - The View is JSON response.
    - The response is from the Controller.
