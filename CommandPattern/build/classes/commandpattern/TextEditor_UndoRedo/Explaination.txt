In this example, the Command Pattern is applied in a text editor where actions like writing and deleting text are reversible.



Explaining => "text.delete(text.length() - length, text.length());"

it is part of a `StringBuilder` operation in Java, and it performs the following actions:

1. `text`: This is a `StringBuilder` object that holds a mutable sequence of characters (text).
2. `text.length()`: This method returns the current length of the string in the `StringBuilder`, i.e., the number of characters in the text.
3. `text.length() - length`: This calculates the starting index for the deletion. It means, "start deleting characters `length` characters back from the end of the string."
4. `text.length()`: This is the ending index (exclusive) of the range to be deleted. It represents the end of the string, meaning it will delete characters up to the very last character.

### Example Breakdown
Suppose `text` contains the string `"Hello, World!"`, and `length = 7`: [the actual value of length would depend on the context of your code.]

- `text.length()`: The length of `"Hello, World!"` is 13.
- `text.length() - length`: This calculates `13 - 7 = 6`. So, deletion starts at index 6.
- `text.delete(6, 13)`: This deletes all characters starting from index 6 up to the end of the string, which removes `" World!"`.

After executing this line, the `text` will now contain `"Hello,"`, with everything after the 6th index deleted.


```JAVA
// Command Interface
interface Command {
    //execute(); //adding text
    //undo(); //deleting text
}

// Receiver
class TextEditor {
    //text from object StringBuilder
    
    //addText()
    //deleteText()
    //getText()
}

// Concrete Command for adding text
class AddTextCommand implements Command {
    //editor attribute (type: TextEditor)
    //textToAdd attribute (Type: String)

    //cons to pass the attributes

    //execute() for adding text
    //undo() for deleting text
}

// Invoker
class EditorInvoker {
    //command attribute
    //setter to pass the command [you can use the cons instead, but in this situation setter is better to avoid making objects everytime.]
    //performAction() for execute()
    //undoAction() for undo()

    public void performAction() {
        command.execute();
    }

    public void undoAction() {
        command.undo();
    }
}

// Client code
public class CommandPatternEditorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //TextEditor obj
        //AddTextCommand obj
        //EditorInvoker obj
        //setter
        //performAction()
        //you can check from getString
        //undoAction()
        //you can check from getString
        }
}
